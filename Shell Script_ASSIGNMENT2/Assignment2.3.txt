Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run. Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, using inline comments, what each command is doing.





#!/bin/bash
# MYUSERNAME="KAJAL" # the username for this application
MYUSERNAME="JERRY" # new username added later
echo "We are using the default user called: $MYUSERNAME" # display to the console
DATETIMESTAMP=`date`
echo "This is when the script was run: $DATETIMESTAMP" # this is the timestamp of run

Terminal OUTPUT:-

kajal@kajal:~/Desktop/Assignment2$ sh Assignment2.3.sh
We are using the default user called: JERRY
This is when the script was run: Sunday 07 August 2021 01:40:32 PM IST
kajal@kajal:~/Desktop/Assignment2$
