Write a script that takes a single command line parameter intended to be the user's first name. Prompt the user for their age and read that into a variable. Using the appropriate method to make that command line parameter visible to a function, pass the age captured to the function and display a message to the user addressing them by name and confirming their age, add a calculation of their age in number of days.



#!/bin/bash
# global variable
USERNAME=$1
# function definitions - start
# calculate age in days
funcAgeInDays () {
echo "Hello $USERNAME, You are $1 Years Old."
echo "That makes you approximately `expr $1 \* 365` days old..."
}
# function definitions - stop
# scrip - start
clear
echo "Enter Your Age: "
read USERAGE
# calculate the number of days
funcAgeInDays $USERAGE

Terminal OUTPUT:-

Enter Your Age: 
21
Hello , You are 21 Years Old.
That makes you approximately 7665 days old...
