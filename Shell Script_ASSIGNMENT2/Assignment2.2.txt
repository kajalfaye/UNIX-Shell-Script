Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.





#!/bin/bash
MYUSERNAME="kajalfaye"
MYPASSWORD="password123"
STARTOFSCRIPT=`date`
echo "My login name for this application is: $MYUSERNAME"
echo "My login password for this application is: $MYPASSWORD"
echo "I started this script at: $STARTOFSCRIPT"
ENDOFSCRIPT=`date`
echo "I ended this script at: $ENDOFSCRIPT"


Terminal OUTPUT:-


kajal@kajal:~/Desktop/Assignment2$ sh Assignment2.2.sh
My login name for this application is: kajalfaye
My login password for this application is: password123
I started this script at: Sunday 08 August 2021 03:29:03 PM IST
I ended this script at: Sunday 08 August 2021 03:29:03 PM IST
kajal@kajal:~/Desktop/Assignment2$
