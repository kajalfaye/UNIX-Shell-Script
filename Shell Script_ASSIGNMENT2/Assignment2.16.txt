Create a simple text file containing a list of super heros (or some names if preferred), use at least four values, one per line in the file.

Write a bash shell script that then reads that file and displays it line by line on the terminal window.




#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a filename to read: "
read FILE
while read -r USER; do
 echo "User Name: $USER"
done < "$FILE"


Terminal OUTPUT:-


kajal@kajal:~/Desktop/Assignment2$ sh Assignment2.16.sh
Enter a filename to read: 
Assignment2.8.sh
User Name: #!/bin/bash
User Name: # interactive script for user input
User Name: echo "Enter Your First Name: "
User Name: read FIRSTNAME
User Name: echo "Enter Your Last Name: "
User Name: read LASTNAME
User Name: echo ""
User Name: echo "Your Full Name is: $FIRSTNAME $LASTNAME"
User Name: echo ""
User Name: echo "Enter Your Age: "
User Name: read USERAGE
User Name: echo "In 10 Years, You will be `expr $USERAGE + 10` years old."
User Name: 
kajal@kajal:~/Desktop/Assignment2$
