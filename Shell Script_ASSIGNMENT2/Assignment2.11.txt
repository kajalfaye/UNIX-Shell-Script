Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable. Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value). If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.




#!/bin/bash
echo "Guess the Secret Number"
echo "======================="
echo ""
echo "Enter a Number Between 1 and 5:"
read GUESS
if [ $GUESS -eq 3 ]
 then
 echo "You Guessed the Correct Number!"
fi
