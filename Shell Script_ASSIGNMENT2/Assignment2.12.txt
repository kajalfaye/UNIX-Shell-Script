Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3. Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable. Be sure to display the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to follow instructions. Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null (to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).


#!/bin/bash
clear
echo "Enter a number between 1 and 3:"
read VALUE
if [ "$VALUE" -eq "1" ] 2>/dev/null; then
 echo "You entered #1"
elif [ "$VALUE" -eq "2" ] 2>/dev/null; then
 echo "You successfully entered #2"
elif [ "$VALUE" -eq "3" ] 2>/dev/null; then
 echo "You entered the 3rd number"
else
 echo "You didn't follow the directions!"
fi


Terminal OUTPUT:-

Enter a number between 1 and 3:
2
You successfully entered #2
